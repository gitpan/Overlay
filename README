  Once you have downloaded Overload-0.01.tar.gz, unpack it somewhere
(tar xzvf Overload-0.01.tar.gz) and enter the Overload directory that was
created. In there, you will find an INSTALL file that will describe the
simple installation procedure.

  The Tie::Hash::Overlay package has a pod attached that contains all of
the interesting usage info.

  If you come up with any creative uses for my package, find a bug, have
a suggestion as to how you would like to see my package evolve, a question
regarding the package, or just plain want a cool feature added, please
e-mail me at jql@accessone.com.
