So... you've decided to install Tie::Hash::Overlay.

Fortunatly the installation procedure is pretty simple. Once you've
downloaded and untarred the Overlay package, enter the directory that was
created and run the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make test

At the end, there will be a number of tests, they should all say
'ok <number>'. If *any* of the tests fail, send me an e-mail, quick!

If all the tests have succeesed, run the commands:

make install
perl test.pl

The 'make install' will install the files so that they are globally
available, and the 'perl test.pl' will test to make sure that they've been
properly installed. If all of the tests are okay, you have successfully
installed Tie::Hash::Overlay.

I recommend you read the Tie::Hash::Overlay(3) man-page and start
programming away!
